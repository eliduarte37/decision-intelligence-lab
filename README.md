# decision-intelligence-lab
This repository documents my work upgrading classical analytics, causal inference, and forecasting workflows using modern AI-assisted methods.

The goal is not to replace disciplined statistical practice, but to augment it: improving speed, consistency, documentation, evaluation, and decision reliability using LLMs, retrieval systems, and agent-based workflows.

## Focus areas
- Causal inference and impact analysis (traditional vs AI-augmented workflows)
- Forecasting and KPI systems
- Experimentation design and evaluation
- Analytics automation and decision support
- Reliability, evaluation, and guardrails for AI-assisted analytics

## Initial projects (in progress)
1. AI-assisted causal impact analysis (R → standardized + agent-supported workflow)
2. Forecasting workflow comparison: classical vs AI-augmented
3. Decision documentation and auditability using RAG
4. Resurfacing and extending prior research with modern tooling

This repository will evolve incrementally as experiments, benchmarks, and case studies are added.
