## Causal Impact

This section revisits classical causal inference workflows used in production analytics:
- Difference-in-differences
- Synthetic control
- Bayesian structural time series

Each method is implemented in a baseline form, followed by an agent-augmented version that assists with:
- data validation
- model selection
- assumption checking
- result interpretation

The goal is to compare reliability, variance, and failure modes between approaches.
