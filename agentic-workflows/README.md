## Agentic Workflows

This section explores agent-based systems for analytical work.

Focus areas:
- retrieval-augmented analysis (RAG)
- planning vs execution separation
- tool use for data access and modeling
- explicit evaluation and guardrails

Emphasis is placed on correctness, transparency, and failure detection rather than automation for its own sake.
